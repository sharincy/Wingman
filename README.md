# Wingman
Elementary System Programming Project Wingman

# The introduction
I would like to introduce my project from the third category, C3 Personal Data Management. I considered the name "Wingman" to mean someone who provides support and assistance to a friend in various situations. In the context of a to-do list, this name could suggest that this application is there to support and assist users in managing their tasks, just like a helpful friend or "wingman."

# Overview 
The Rust Task Manager is a command-line application that allows users to manage their to-do list by performing various tasks, including adding, viewing, editing, deleting, marking as complete, and exporting tasks to different formats.



# Feature 
The Rust Task Manager provides the following features: 

Add Task: Users can add a new task by specifying a title and a description for the task. 

View Tasks: Users can view the list of tasks along with their titles, descriptions, and completion status. 

Edit Task: Users can edit an existing task by providing the task number, a new title, and a new description. 

Delete Task: Users can delete a task by specifying its task number. 

Mark as Complete: Users can mark a task as complete by specifying its task number. 

Export Tasks: Users can export the list of tasks to a file in either JSON or YAML format. Users can specify the name of the output file and the format.
